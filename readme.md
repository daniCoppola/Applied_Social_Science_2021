## Recreate the hyperlink
###
In order to reproduce our work download the common crawl graph from http://commoncrawl.org/2019/02/host-and-domainlevel-
web-graphs-nov-dec-2018-jan-2019/. 
###
Filter for the domains present in input_files/domains obtained from https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/
The filter script have some function to help.
###
Get the leaning for the domains from https://github.com/gitronald/domains.
###
Finally, it is time to put everything together and load the graph with networkx

## Network analysis
Inside the network analysis script there are function useful to plot leanings and 
degree of the domains

## Louvain
This script was used to plot the distribution of leanings in the different communities computed
in VISone using Louvain Algorithm.
